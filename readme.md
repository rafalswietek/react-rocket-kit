## Super fresh react app starter
EDIT: IT IS NOT THAT FRESH ANYMORE! :(

### Installing dependencies

Before you start, make sure you download all dependencies. \
`$ yarn install`

### How to run the development server

The app uses webpack-dev-server to allow an easy and pleasant way of development. \
To start the development server just run: \
`$ yarn start-dev`

### How to build the app for production

The app uses webpack with it's default production configuration. \
To build the app just run: \
`$ yarn build` \
\
After the build is complete you will find compiled files ready for production in the `/dist` folder.

### NodeJS http server

This repo also contains a simple NodeJS http server. To use it, first build the app, then run: \
`$ yarn start` \
\
The server is listening on port 3000 by default.
